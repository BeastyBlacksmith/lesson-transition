# Transitioning Carpentries Lessons

This repository will contain scripts for transitioning Carpentries lessons built
from [the all-in-one infrastructure](https://github.com/carpentries/styles) (aka 
"The Lesson Template") to [the decoupled/centralised 
infrastructure](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs) (aka "The Lesson
Infrastructure"). 

These scripts require a setup with R and access to the internet. It is currently
a work in progress and may evolve in the future.

## Usage

To add a lesson for translation, there are two steps:

1. add an R script with the repository name under a folder with the organisation
   name (e.g. `swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder.R` or 
  `datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson.R`). 
2. run `make`

### Notes

The `transform-lesson.R` script is meant to serve as a generalized method for
converting lesson content from one engine to the other. It does the majority of
the heavy lifting, but it can not completely convert lessons perfectly. Because
each lesson is built in a _slightly_ different way and kramdown (Jekyll's 
markdown parser) allows for patterns that would be invalid in any other parser,
the conversion is not 100%. This additional R script allows you to make
additional changes such as moving files or fixing errors. This file can be blank
if there are no changes you wish to make

If your lesson is in a repository that does not belong to an official carpentries
account, you will need to append the `DIRS` varaible in the makefile.

## Requirements

The packages used in this script are the same packages that are used in 
{sandpaper}, you can [follow the setup instructions to get this script working
](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/setup) with the following 
exceptions (which may update):

1. install the {docopt} package: `install.pacakges("docopt")`
2. install [{tinkr} pull request 57](https://github.com/ropensci/tinkr/pull/57): `remotes::install_github("ropensci/tinkr#57")`

## Post translation

After a lesson is translated it lives in a brand new repository that will have
three commits:

1. the bootstrap of the new lesson
2. the first pass of `transform-lesson.R`
3. Any other changes dictated by your custom script. 

To get this to GitHub, I like to use the {usethis} package:

```r
# In the directory of the new lesson
library(usethis)
use_github(organization = "data-lessons")
```

After a few minutes, the lesson will be sent to GitHub and build the site, but
the pages need to be activated, which you can do via usethis:

```r
# In the directory of the new lesson
library(usethis)
use_github_pages()
```
