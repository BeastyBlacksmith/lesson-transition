# Transitioning Carpentries Lessons

This repository will contain scripts for transitioning Carpentries lessons built
from [the all-in-one infrastructure](https://github.com/carpentries/styles) (aka 
"The Lesson Template") to [the decoupled/centralised 
infrastructure](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs) (aka "The Lesson
Infrastructure"). 

These scripts require a setup with R and access to the internet. It is currently
a work in progress and may evolve in the future.
